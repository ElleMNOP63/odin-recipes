            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <ol> 
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <li>Combine the eggs and milk in the container of a blender. Add the flour, salt and sugar, and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray or butter. Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, and tilt the pan to coat the bottom. Cook until the top looks dry, about 30 seconds. Carefully slide a spatula under the pancake and flip. Cook for a few seconds on the other side, just until browned. Remove to a plate, and repeat with remaining batter.</li>
